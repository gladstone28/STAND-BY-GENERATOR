Here are three strong generator options you can consider on Amazon — they align reasonably well with your standby-use scenario for a ~5 kW generator. Note though: since you’re in Jamaica, check for shipping availability, duties/taxes, and whether the unit is specified for 50 Hz if that’s your mains frequency.
