## ‚úÖ Essential Loads (Run Continuously)
| Appliance | Watts | Priority | Notes |
|------------|------:|:---------:|-------|
| Refrigerator | 700 | High | Keep food fresh |
| Freezer | 600 | High | Alternate with fridge if needed |
| LED Lights (10 bulbs) | 100 | High | Use energy-efficient bulbs |
| Wi-Fi Router + TV | 200 | High | For communication and updates |
| Fan | 100 | Medium | Comfort in warm weather |

**Subtotal:** ‚âà 1,700 W (Continuous)

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Moderate Loads (Cycle or Alternate)
| Appliance | Watts | Priority | Usage Strategy |
|------------|------:|:---------:|----------------|
| Water Pump (¬Ω HP) | 1000 | High | Use intermittently (e.g., 10‚Äì15 mins/hour) |
| Microwave | 1200 | Medium | Run for short cooking periods |
| Computer / Laptop | 250 | Medium | Use during work or emergencies |
| Sump Pump | 1000 | High | Let run automatically as needed |

**Subtotal:** ‚âà 3,450 W (With some cycling)

---

## üïê Optional Loads (Use Sparingly)
| Appliance | Watts | Priority | Notes |
|------------|------:|:---------:|-------|
| Iron | 1500 | Low | Turn off major loads before using |
| Small Window A/C | 1800 | Medium | Only if no other high load is active |
| Power Tools | 1000‚Äì1500 | Medium | Use one at a time |

**Keep total under:** ‚âà **4,000 W continuous / 5,000 W max surge**

## ‚öñÔ∏è Recommended Load Balancing Plan

| Circuit | Connected Appliances | Estimated Load | Status |
|----------|----------------------|----------------|--------|
| **A** | Refrigerator, Lights, TV | 1000 W | Continuous |
| **B** | Freezer, Router, Fan | 800 W | Continuous |
| **C** | Water Pump | 1000 W | Intermittent |
| **D** | Microwave / Computer | 1200 W | Alternating |
| **E** | Optional (Iron / A/C) | 1000‚Äì1500 W | Only when others off |

**Total Active Load:** ‚âà **3,800‚Äì4,000 W average**  
‚Üí Keeps generator safe and efficient.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Safety Notes

1. Use a **transfer switch** to connect household circuits safely.  
2. Never exceed **80% continuous load** for long periods.  
3. Avoid **starting multiple heavy appliances** at once ‚Äî start them one at a time.  
4. Always operate generator **outdoors** and perform regular maintenance.  
5. **Test monthly** to ensure your backup setup works when needed.
